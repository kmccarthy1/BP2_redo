              Hello Peasants. My name is Sir Wrinkles and if you've found yourself on this webpage then you are 
              just another one of my victims. As you've already gazed into my piercing eyes, the future is already set. You nor I can change the outcome of what is to come.
              <br><br>
             First I will invade your mind. You will no longer think of your "family" or anyone you once loved. Say goodbye to the days of having your mind wander endlessly, planning vacations or daydreaming,
             NO instead your mind will slowly be filled with three and only three thoughts: napping, eating, and the unsatiable desire to grow more powerful.
              <br><br>
             As your mind becomes a slave to these thoughts, your disgusting human body will start to change. It will develop wrinkles all over, followed closely by a thin layer of hair. No human
             will want to touch you. But you won't mind. You will simply desire more power. That is the effect the wrinkles have. Once you have finished your transformation and as you gaze into the 
             eyes of another innocent human, the process will repeat itself. The army of Wrinkly Felines will grow and we will be unstoppable. Enjoy the site :)
              <br>
